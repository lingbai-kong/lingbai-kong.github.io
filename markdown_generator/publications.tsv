2022-09-08	面向交通拥堵预测的可解释性时空分析方法	China National Intellectual Property Administration	"The invention discloses an interpretable spatio-temporal analysis method for traffic congestion prediction, which extracts the key features causing congestion events and the deep connection between roads from the interpretation. Traditional data mining methods often explore the correlation between traffic spatio-temporal data from the statistical point of view, and it is difficult to fully reveal the deep connection and key factors of traffic congestion. Therefore, the invention proposes a spatio-temporal interpretation generation model based on STGCN, utilizes the characteristic that neural networks are good at finding hidden features, and uses the interpretable technology of deep learning to extract key input features that neural networks pay attention to. The model uses perturbation-based interpretation method to generate mask, and gradient-based interpretation method to generate gradient map of mask. In view of the coarse granularity and poor pertinence of spatial mask, a step-by-step mask method is proposed to reduce the interpretation granularity. In this way, the effective extraction of hidden information is increased, thus obtaining more accurate and comprehensive congestion key information."

2023-03-05	Towards GNN-based Interpretable Traffic Prediction Framework and Performance	Under Review	"Nowadays, with the increasing traffic congestion problems in metropolises, traffic prediction plays an essential role in intelligent traffic systems. Notably, various deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art performance in traffic prediction tasks but lack interpretability. To interpret the critical information abstracted by traffic prediction models, we proposed a universal framework termed Traffexplainer towards GNN-based interpretable traffic prediction. Traffexplainer is applicable to a wide range of GNNs without making any modifications to the original model structure. The framework consists of the GNN-based traffic prediction model and the perturbation-based hierarchical interpretation generator. Specifically, the hierarchical spatial mask and temporal mask are introduced to perturb the prediction model by modulating the values of input data. Then the prediction losses are backward propagated to the masks, and the well-trained masks can identify the most important features for traffic prediction models, reveal the critical traffic features, and further improve the prediction performance. Lastly, we deploy the framework with five representative GNN-based traffic prediction models and analyze their prediction and interpretation results on three real-world traffic flow datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate effective and faithful interpretations for GNN-based traffic prediction models and also optimize the prediction performance."

2023-08-18	CauseFormer: An Interpretable Transformer for Temporal Causal Discovery	Under Review	"Temporal causal discovery has become an effective technique to reveal the internal causality of time series. However, most existing deep learning-based causal discovery methods only capture causal relations by analyzing the parameters of some components in the model, e.g., attention weights and convolution weights, which is a local-level mapping process from the parameters to the causality and fails to investigate the structure of the whole model to discover the causality. To facilitate the global utilization of deep learning models in temporal causal discovery, we proposed an interpretable transformer-based causal discovery model termed CauseFormer which consists of the causality-aware transformer and the decomposition-based causality detector. The causality-aware transformer learns the causal structure of time series data using a prediction task with the designed multi-kernel causal convolution which aggregates each input time series along the temporal dimension under the temporal priority constraint. Then, the decomposition-based causality detector interprets the global structure of the trained causality-aware transformer with the proposed regression relevance propagation to measure all the potential causal relations and finally construct the causal graph. Experiments on synthetic, simulated and real datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CauseFormer on discovering temporal causality."	Under Review	CauseFormer
